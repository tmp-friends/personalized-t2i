## Features

- 🧩 **Learnable User Embedding**
Initializes an independent trainable vector for each user, jointly optimized via the diffusion model’s Flow Matching Loss and Dispersion Loss, ensuring that the user preference embeddings naturally align with the text-to-image model’s representation distribution while effectively distinguishing and separating different user preferences.
- 🚀**Prompt Preference Modulation (PPM)**
Dynamically generates a context-aware modulation direction for each text token, enabling fine-grained, semantically aligned preference injection.
- 📝 **Strong Text Instruction-Following**: Compared to full-parameter/low-rank fine-tuning methods like LoRA, Premier injects preferences while minimally compromising the base model's ability to parse and generate from complex prompts.
- 📊 **Lightweight & Efficiency**
  - 💾 **Minimal Storage**: Single-user preference embedding occupies only ≈61 KB
  - ⚡ **Zero-Cost Inference**: Adds only ≈1 second inference overhead, independent of resolution.
  - ⏱️ **Fast Training**: Single-user adaptation takes approximately 30 minutes.
  
  
## Quick Start
### Setup 
1. **Environment setup**
```bash
conda create -n premier python=3.12
conda activate premier
```
2. **Requirements installation**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Data Preparation
The training data should be saved as a `.pkl` file containing a **list of users**.  
Each user is represented as a **list of entries**, where:

- Each **entry (except the last one)** corresponds to a preference image and consists of:
  ```python
  [image_path: str, input_text_prompt: str]
- The last entry contains auxiliary user metadata (not used during training).
  ```python
  [
    # User 0
    [
        ["./data/user0/img1.jpg", "a cute cat sitting on a windowsill"],
        ["./data/user0/img2.jpg", "a dog playing in the park with a red ball"],
        # ... more image-text pairs ...
        {"user_id": "user0",}  # unused in training
    ],
    # ... more users ...
  ]
During training of user preference embeddings, the data must be split into **historical (training) samples** and **test samples**. The resulting splits are saved as CSV files with the following column names:

-  `positive_image`: Path to the user's preferred image  
- `caption`: Text prompt or description provided by the user for that image
  

### Usage example
```shell
  # train preference adapter
  ./monitor_pid.sh
  # train user embedding by linear combination
  ./monitor_pid_user_linear.sh
  # direct training user embedding
  ./monitor_pid_user.sh
  # generate images
  ./monitor_pid_generate.sh
```
